This code implements a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) to generate images of MNIST digits, using a critic (discriminator) with weight clipping to stabilize learning, and saving periodic visual samples. The training alternates between 5 iterations of the critic (with a weight constraint via clip_value=0.01) and 1 iteration of the generator, optimized via RMSprop as recommended in the original WGAN article.
